# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Neural Networks

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. It tackles the challenge of highly imbalanced datasets with oversampling techniques and evaluates model performance using key classification metrics.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Developed a neural network model (MLP) to detect fraud in credit card transactions.
- Addressed severe class imbalance using **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**.
- Trained and compared two MLP models:
  - A **basic MLP** architecture.
  - An **MLP with Dropout** to reduce overfitting.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.
- Implemented **Early Stopping** to prevent overtraining.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **ROC-AUC Score**

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras / TensorFlow
- ADASYN (from `imblearn`)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## ðŸš€ Results

- The **dropout-enhanced MLP** showed improved generalization and better fraud detection performance.
- Achieved higher **F1-score and ROC-AUC** compared to the basic model.
- Model training was more efficient due to early stopping and optimized hyperparameters.
